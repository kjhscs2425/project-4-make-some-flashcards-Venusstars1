2. How many times will you show each flashcard the first time the user runs your flashcards program?
The first time the user runs the flaschards, each flashcard will be shown once in a random order.

3. How will the number of times you show each flashcard change the second time the user runs the program, based on their performance the previous time?
Based on their performance, the flashcards that they got wrong will be shown twice while the ones they got right will only be shown once. 

4. What information will you need to store in a file in order to make the program change it's behavior each time the user runs the program?

The information needed to be stored in a file is how many they got wrong and specifically, which flashcards the user got wrong. That way, the more users get a certain flasshcard wrong, the more that flashcard will show up.
